# LeetCode Problems

## A Collection of LeetCode Problems for personal Practice

This repository features a collection of LeetCode problems I've been working on. Each problem is organized by its difficulty level, followed by the problem number on LeetCode and its title.

### Problem Naming Convention

Each problem follows a consistent naming convention:
- `e` = Easy
- `m` = Medium
- `h` = Hard
- `p` = Problem
- `Problem number` = The specific question number on LeetCode
- `Problem Title` = The title of the problem

For example:
- `ep1twosum`
- `mp153Sum`
- `hp4medianoftwosortedarrays`

### Contents of Each Package

Each problem is contained in its own package, which includes:
- A `README.md` file describing the problem.
- The solution to the problem, written in the corresponding programming language.
- A `Main` method that implements the solution, allowing you to run and test it.

Feel free to explore!
